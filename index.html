    <h2>What You’ll Need to Make Thai Tea at Home</h2>
    <p>The beauty of Thai tea lies in its simplicity. You only need a handful of ingredients, most of which you probably already have in your kitchen. Here’s what you’ll need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Thai Tea Mix</strong>: This is the star of the show! Thai tea mix is made from black tea leaves, spices, and food coloring, which gives the tea its iconic orange hue.</li>
      <li><strong>Water</strong>: For brewing the tea, of course.</li>
      <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Thai tea is known for its sweetness, so sugar is a must.</li>
      <li><strong>Condensed Milk</strong>: This adds creaminess and a touch of sweetness.</li>
      <li><strong>Ice</strong>: If you’re making iced Thai tea, ice is essential for that refreshing chill.</li>
      <li><strong>Optional Toppings</strong>: Want to take your Thai tea to the next level? Add a dollop of whipped cream, a sprinkle of cinnamon, or even a splash of coconut milk for extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Thai Tea at Home</h2>
    <p>Now that you’ve got your ingredients ready, let’s get brewing! Making Thai tea at home is easier than you might think. Just follow these simple steps:</p>
    
    <h3>Step 1: Brew the Tea</h3>
    <p>Start by boiling 4 cups of water in a pot. Once the water is boiling, add ½ cup of Thai tea mix (or black tea leaves) and let it steep for about 5 minutes. The longer you steep, the stronger the flavor will be.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 2: Sweeten It Up</h3>
    <p>While the tea is still hot, add ½ cup of sugar (or more if you like it extra sweet). Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 3: Let It Cool</h3>
    <p>Once the tea is brewed and sweetened, let it cool to room temperature. You can speed up the process by placing the pot in an ice bath or transferring the tea to a pitcher and refrigerating it.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 4: Add the Creamy Goodness</h3>
    <p>Now comes the fun part—adding the condensed milk! Pour the cooled tea into a glass filled with ice, leaving some room at the top. Then, drizzle 1-2 tablespoons of condensed milk over the tea.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 5: Mix and Enjoy</h3>
    <p>Give your Thai tea a good stir to mix the condensed milk with the tea. Take a sip, and let the sweet, creamy, and slightly spiced flavors transport you to a tropical paradise.</p>
    
    <div class="tip">
      <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you want to avoid straining later, use a tea infuser or a cheesecloth to hold the tea leaves.</p>

    <h2>Tips for the Perfect Thai Tea</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use High-Quality Ingredients</strong>: The better the tea mix, the better your Thai tea will taste.</li>
      <li><strong>Adjust the Sweetness</strong>: Thai tea is traditionally sweet, but you can reduce the amount of sugar or condensed milk if you prefer a less sweet drink.</li>
      <li><strong>Experiment with Milk</strong>: While condensed milk is the classic choice, you can also use evaporated milk, whole milk, or even almond milk for a dairy-free version.</li>
      <li><strong>Make It Ahead of Time</strong>: Thai tea tastes even better when it’s chilled, so feel free to make a big batch and store it in the fridge for up to 3 days.</li>
    </ul>
